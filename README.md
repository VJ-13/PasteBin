PasteBin is a lightweight and efficient web application, developed in NodeJS using Express and EJS, designed to mimic the popular HasteBin platform. The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a secure and user-friendly platform to share and store code snippets or text content with ease.

The project taught me the importance of scalable and maintainable code practices, allowing me to deliver a feature-rich and reliable application. I mastered MongoDB integration to manage data efficiently and ensured smooth retrieval and storage of user content. I also delved into the complexity of creating secure HTTPS routes using Express to safeguard user data during communication. This project showcases my expertise in web development and highlights my proficiency in building RESTful APIs, implementing secure data handling, and creating visually appealing front-end interfaces.
